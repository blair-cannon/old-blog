**What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?**
<br>
<br>
I'm excited for having the coding skills to do more with data and testing frameworks which at the moment isn't even something I can picture what it would look like on my screen lol. This is also I hard question for me because I feel like there are LOTS of things that in the near future I will wish I had the skills for as they become obvious to me, but at the moment I really only know the capabilities of coding from Google. I'm intrigued to see behind the curtain in the bootcamp.

**What are you struggling with?**
<br>
<br>
This week felt pretty good! There were some small struggles along the way but honestly at the end of each of them, I felt like I learned more than I ever could have if someone just fixed it for me \(even though in the moment someone else's knowledge is all that I wanted haha\). 

Anyways, I would say that I am struggling at times to know where and why a property should go in one div, container, or within a certain selector versus another one. For example, in a tree with a parent that has two div children and then there are children within each div as well--I get a little confused. In typing that out it seems simple, select for the most specific selector that you want to apply a property to. Yet, I think when it gets into organizing spaces on a website and doing margins, padding, width, etc. for a flexbox or container, I was struggling to conceptualize where a property needed to go. 

**How do you solve a problem?**
<br>
<br>
I have really been enjoying the way I have found to problem solve with coding this week. When I couldn't get something to work like I thought it would, I found that making that whole part a note and starting that part of the code over again was a helpful way for me to get to the solution. I would still have the code there if I needed it again and I could also look at it and write new code that is slightly different or completely different than my first attempt and see what I get that time. If my first attempt was closer, I would try again trying to tweak but stay closer to the first try. Or, if the second try was closer I would continue on that path. I would continue trial and error until I could figure it out or have a more specific question that I could then google. This was also useful with this weeks project for reviewing over my code and blocking out certain lines as notes if I wasn't sure what they were doing anf ended up finding a few lines that were redundant and reminding myself what certain lines of the code were intended for. 

**What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?**
<br>
<br>
Definitely Google. And definitely setting a property value in CSS to 100 or whatever a high value for a property might be to then switch over to the live server to better visualize exactly what a property is doing--I did this a lot this week haha. I also got unstuck one or two times this spring with the DevTools which helped me see the code in a different setting which is always helpful for catching a typo or error.
