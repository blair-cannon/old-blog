My thoughts are that whoever invented the 'tech stack' is a genius!!! I love how it all gets integrated together and how they each have their own individual functions.
I wouldn't know any different if it was set up with one interface that did all of the functions, yet I am so glad to have it set it up in a user-friendly way.
I am excited to use these three and other interfaces going forward and keep getting more comfortable with each of them.

My blog has been on my list to update and make better now that I know how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It only incorpoartes markdown at the moment, so it is 
nothing fancy haha!
